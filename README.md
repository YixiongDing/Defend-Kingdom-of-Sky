# Defend-Kingdom-of-Sky
A voxel 3D Tower Defence game made with Unity

‘Defend Kingdom of Sky’ is a cartoon-typed 3-D tower defence game. The goal of the game is to set up turrets to defeat all the monster invaders so that the kingdom can find its peace back. The monsters come out from the portal on one side of the kingdom and they follow the path to the gate on the other side of the kingdom (which is the entrance of the castle). The monsters come in waves and the player has to stop them from getting into the castle. The game has two levels featuring two different themed maps - Forest and Ice World, in which the player can enjoy the unusual gaming experience. What’s more, there are various kinds of monsters in the game, and also different turrets that the player can choose to defend the kingdom.
